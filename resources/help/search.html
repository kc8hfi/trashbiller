     <p>There are multiple ways to search for a customer.  
     <ul>
          <li>By account number
          <li>By any of the other fields
     </ul>
     <h3>By account number</h3>
     <p>The entire account number doesn't have to be keyed in.   By default, the program
     uses wild cards automatically when searching by the account number.  To search by account number:</p>
     <ol>
          <li>Type in the account number
          <li>Press enter
     </ol>
     <h3>By the other fields</h3>
     <p>If searching by any of the other fields, a % sign can be used for a wild card.  Each field is also 
     case-insensititive.  For example,  if searching for a first name of John, one could type in "jo%" to 
     get anybody with the first name that starts with jo.</p>
     <p>Each field can be mixed and matched.  You can search by the address and zip, or by the last name and state, or 
     any combination of the fields.</p>
